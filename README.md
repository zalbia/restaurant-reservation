# Restaurant Reservation System

## TODO

- Implement updating
- Add more OpenAPI documentation
- Add Javadoc
- Write Postman Collection
- Implement quartz scheduler logic for reminder jobs

## Design Decisions

- Top-down approach, define documented API then work way down.
- Although this is just an assignment, REST APIs evolve different versions so I prepend an API version number to the
  URLs.
- Spring Data JDBC over Spring Data JPA.
- Support phone number validation using [libphonenumber](https://github.com/google/libphonenumber).
    - Phone numbers form a complex domain, and rolling out own validation is unnecessary.
    - Delegating to the library leads to a more forgiving phone number API argument.
- Distinct validations at the API layer and domain layer.
- Use auto-incremented IDs in h2
    - Simple, suitable for a single node as is the case in this assignment.
- Use Java 21 records to cut down on the amount of boilerplate for this assignment.
- To keep scope in check for this assignment, booking reservations returns an auto-incremented guest ID for managing
  reservations instead of managing a guest entity.
    - In a bigger system, guest IDs would just be provided.
- Limited logging only for client-friendly error messages for the API, and appropriate response status codes.
- Created an exception hierarchy for internal customer booking errors.
    - These runtime errors are allowed to bubble up to the web layer and handled accordingly.

## Assumptions Made

- Names can only be 1-100 characters long.
- Local phone numbers are from the Philippines.
- There can only be up to 8 guests per reservation per group reservation policy.
- All dates and times are local.
- There isn't a definite limit to the total number of reservations booked for a restaurant.
- Restaurant is open 24/7. ðŸ˜±
- Upcoming reservations are viewed from earliest to latest.

## Nice to have

- Add discoverability (next, previous, etc.) to getting paginated reservations
- Consider "idempotency" of creating reservations, e.g. only allowing one reservation under one name per day.
