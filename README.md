# Restaurant Reservation System

## TODO

- Add more OpenAPI documentation
- Add Javadoc
- Implement services
- Integration Tests!
- Implement quartz scheduler logic for reminder jobs

## Design Decisions

- Top-down approach, define documented API then work way down.
- Although this is just an assignment, REST APIs evolve different versions, so I prepend an API version number to the
  URLs.
- Spring Data JPA, so I don't have to implement and test my own pagination for this project.
- Support phone number validation using [libphonenumber](https://github.com/google/libphonenumber).
    - Phone numbers form a complex domain, and rolling out own validation is unnecessary.
    - Delegating to the library leads to a more forgiving phone number API argument.
- Distinct validations at the API layer and domain layer.
- Use auto-incremented IDs in h2
    - Simple, suitable for a single node as is the case in this assignment.
- Use Java 21 records to cut down on the amount of boilerplate for this assignment.
- Filter views by reservation name.
- Limited logging only for client-friendly error messages for the API, and appropriate response status codes.
- Created an exception hierarchy for internal customer booking errors.
    - These runtime errors are allowed to bubble up to the web layer and handled accordingly.

## Assumptions Made

- Names can only be 1-100 characters long.
- Local phone numbers are from the Philippines.
- There can only be up to 8 guests per reservation per group reservation policy.
- All dates and times are local.
- There isn't a definite limit to the total number of reservations booked for a restaurant.
- Restaurant is open 24/7. ðŸ˜±

## Nice to have

- Add discoverability (next, previous, etc.) to getting paginated reservations
- Consider "idempotency" of creating reservations, e.g. only allowing one reservation under one name per day.
